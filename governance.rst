Governance
==========

EDAM follows a model with four tiers of governance:

1. **EDAM Steering Group** advises the EDAM Developers on how best to uphold the EDAM principles and achieve its current aims.  It includes (and is open to) representatives of institutes and projects that are adopting EDAM or committing significant resources to it's development.  Steering Group members have five primary responsibilities:

  * Help to set priorities in consultation with the Developers
  * Verify whether stated aims are coherent and wise
  * Monitor progress and provide feedback
  * Help arrange funding for EDAM
  * Advocate EDAM
   
  The EDAM Developers will respect advice of the Steering Group and give quarterly progress reports by email.  The Steering Group will be reconstituted (by the Developers) as and when required to ensure membership reflects current activity and interest. 

2. **EDAM Developers** are typically funded to develop EDAM.  The group is quasi-democratic with a leader (currently Jon Ison) having the final say where necessary.  The leader ensures the Steering Group, and all editors and contributors, are listened to and informed. The leader may be temporarily appointed from the developers as necessary, e.g. during holidays.  Developers must have the intent and some bandwidth to develop EDAM in the long-term. They have 3 primary responsibilities: 

  * Agree aims and general good practice to uphold the EDAM principles
  * Oversee and approve developments and routine maintenance
  * Develop EDAM as bandwidth permits

3. **EDAM Editors** represent the broad life science community, especially scientific experts and end-users.  They include anyone who makes significant contributions to EDAM scientific content, by whatever means, but have none of the commitments or responsibilities of the developers.  EDAM Editors are expected to:

  * Actively offer constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise
  * Advocate EDAM
  * Contribute to EDAM as bandwidth permits
    
4. **Other contributors** do not have GitHub commit rights but can still make comments, contribute suggestions for new terms and other changes. 

We very much welcome new members of the team at all levels above.  Representatives of projects who plan to adopt EDAM are encouraged to join the EDAM Advisory Group.
