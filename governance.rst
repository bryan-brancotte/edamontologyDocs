Governance
==========

EDAM follows a model with five tiers of governance:

1. **EDAM Advisory Group** advises the EDAM Core Developers on how best to uphold the EDAM principles and achieve its current aims. It represents the broad life science community, especially scientist end-users, and adopters of EDAM. Advisory Group members have no formal responsibilities, but are expected to advocate EDAM and actively offer constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise. The EDAM Core Developers will respect this advice and give quarterly progress reports by email. The Core Developers aim to assemble with the Advisory Group virtually 2 or 3 times a year or as circumstances dictate, in meetings with open agenda and followed up with actions and notes on key recommendations. The Advisory Group will be reconstituted each year and the Steering Group (below) reserves the right to replace inactive members. 


2. **EDAM Steering Group** includes representatives of institutes that are committing significant resources to EDAM.  Members of the Steering Group have four primary responsibilities:

  * Agree strategy and set priorities in consultation with the Core Developers
  * Verify whether stated aims are coherent and wise
  * Monitor progress and provide feedback
  * Help arrange funding for EDAM

3. **EDAM Core Developers** are funded to develop EDAM and have GitHub commit rights. Responsible for agreeing aims and general good practice, overseeing and approving developments and routine maintenance. The model is quasi-democratic with a leader (currently Jon Ison) having the final say where necessary. The leader ensures the Advisory Group, and all editors and contributors, are listened to and informed. The leader may be temporarily appointed from the core developers as necessary, e.g. during holidays.  Core Developers must have the intent and some bandwidth to develop EDAM in the long-term. They have 3 primary responsibilities: 

  * Understand and uphold the EDAM principles
  * Advocate EDAM
  * Develop EDAM as bandwidth permits

4. **EDAM Editors** would not normally have GitHub commit rights long-term. They include anyone who makes significant contributions to EDAM scientific content, by whatever means, but have none of the commitments or responsibilities of the core developers.

5. **Other contributors** do not have GitHub commit rights, but can still make comments, contribute suggestions for new terms and other changes. 

We very much welcome new editors and contributors.  Representatives of projects who plan to adopt EDAM are welcome to join the EDAM Advisory Group.
