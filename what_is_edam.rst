What is EDAM?
=============

EDAM is a simple ontology of well established, familiar concepts that are prevalent within bioinformatics, including types of data and data identifiers, data formats, operations and topics. EDAM provides a set of terms with synonyms and definitions - organised into an intuitive hierarchy for convenient use.

OBO format is no longer supported.

Status
------
EDAM is a maturing ontology under active development.  Development is use-case driven, primarily by the ELIXIR Tools & Data Services Registry (`bio.tools <https://bio.tools>`_).  Future versions will not depart fundamentally from the current sub-ontologies or relations (see concepts below).  The development of EDAM can be followed at (`GitHub <github.com/edamontology/edamontology>`_).

Motivation
----------
Bioinformaticians handle an increasingly large and diverse set of tools and data. Meanwhile, researchers demand ever more powerful and convenient means to organise, find, understand, compare, select, use and connect the available resources. These tasks often rely on consistent, machine-understandable descriptions of the underlying components, but these have been generally lacking in _ad hoc_ resource descriptions. The urgent need - filled by EDAM - is for an ontology that unifies semantically the bioinformatics concepts in common use, provides the curator with a comprehensive controlled vocabulary that is broadly applicable, and supports new and powerful search, browse and query functions.

Applications 
------------
EDAM is suitable for large-scale semantic annotations and categorization of diverse bioinformatics resources, including:

- Web services including REST and SOAP APIs
- Application software
- Tool collections and packages
- Workflows / pipelines
- Databases
- XML Schemata and data objects
- Data syntax and file formats
- Web portals and pages
- Resource catalogues
- Training materials 
- Courses, tutorials, and other events
- Areas of scientific interest
- Documents, such as scientific publications

EDAM is also suitable for diverse application including for example within workbenches and workflow-management systems, software distributions, and resource registries.
