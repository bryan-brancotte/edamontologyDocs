Contributors Guide
==================
EDAM is a community project: everyone is encouraged to get involved.



Mailing lists

To find the most efficient way to contribute to EDAM, to get in help using EDAM for resource annotation and in software implementations, and for general discussions, mail:

edam@elixir-dk.org

We'll make every effort to be responsive, given our limited resources, and will work with you to find the most efficient way to proceed, depending on your requirements, expertise and bandwidth.

Requests
--------
Suggestions for addition, corrections, and other improvements to EDAM are always welcome! 

To suggest new concepts, please use the `GitHub tracker <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues/new>`_

Please specify for each concept:

- EDAM sub-ontology (Topic, Operation, Format, Data, Identifier)
- Term (the most common term used to refer to the concept)

It will speed up things a lot if you can also provide:

- short description (a couple of sentences)
- URL of suggested parent
- exact synonyms (other commonly-used terms, acronyms etc. by which the concept is referred to)
- narrow synonyms (terms reflecting specialisations of the concept.  Narrow synonyms can be defined to avoid creating overly-specialised concepts.)
- URL to formal specification (Format concepts only)
- type of data represented (Format concepts only) 
- file extension (Format concepts only) 
- media type (Format concepts only)
- citation DOI (Format concepts only. Only if the article publishes the format and should be cited with every mention or use of the format!) 

If it turns out you need a lot of new concepts, we can find a more efficient way (*e.g.* shared Google sheet), and you can join us as an `EDAM Editor <http://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/governance.html>`_


GitHub issue tracker (preferred)
--------------------------------
If you have a GitHub account, you can make requests by opening a GitHub issue:

- Go to https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues and click on "New issue".
- If you are not logged in, you will be asked first to log in or create an account.
- Provide a title, and a report that is concise but sufficiently detailed to be actionable.

Suggestions form
----------------
Simple requests for one or a few changes can be made using this form:

http://tinyurl.com/EDAMChangeRequest 

If you require many changes and additions, there's probably a more efficient way to proceed: please contact edam@elixir-dk.org.
